# Siemens Coding Challenge

This repository contains a demo application for the Siemens coding challenge. The application is a simple Web application consisting of a frontend application and a backend server.

The frontend is built with Vue.js and the backend is built with Node.js and Express.js. The application allows users to update a counter value and displays the updated value (also from other users) in real-time.
